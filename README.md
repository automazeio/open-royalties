## What is Open Royalties?

**Open Royalties** is an easy way for builders to get upfront cash for new projects *without* selling equity or taking on rigid loans. It's designed for projects that are focused on generating revenue – not speculative moonshots hoping for a big exit.

You raise money from early supporters – they back your idea upfront, and you share a small piece of *project revenue* as you earn.
No big promises. No forced exit. Just clear terms, aligned interests, and real revenue sharing.

## Why this exists

A lot of modern businesses don’t fit old-school funding.

* **Banks:** want collateral and assets.
* **VCs:** want moonshots and unicorns.
* **Revenue lenders:** often have punishing fees or inflexible terms.

**Open Royalties** fills the gap: a simple, flexible way to raise funds for a specific product, feature, or launch – and reward early backers as soon as money comes in.

## What’s included

This repo includes **three ready-to-use templates** for setting up fair, clear royalty deals:

### [📄 `open-royalties-full.md`](open-royalties-full.md)

* Includes a *steering committee* with a seat for your backers.
* They get a say in the project – not full control – so you keep creative freedom, but they stay in the loop.
* Works well for bigger rounds or a group of backers pooling funds.

### [📄 `open-royalties-simple.md`](open-royalties-simple.md)

* Includes a steering committee - but *no formal seat* for backers.
* You run the project fully yourself while sharing revenue as agreed.
* Great for small, quick deals where you want minimal oversight.

### [📄 `open-royalties-partnerships.md`](open-royalties-partnership.md)

* For non-cash deals - partners contribute skills, IP, or work instead of money.
* Clear royalty split based on contribution instead of investment.
* Perfect for collaborations without giving up equity.

All versions are **project-based** – so the rest of your business stays untouched.

## 🔑 How it works

A royalty agreement is just a fair trade:
You get upfront cash to build, launch, or grow – your backers get a slice of the revenue that comes in later.

### ✅ Reference price

The *reference price* is a simple agreed figure for what the project is worth – like a safety net.
If you shut down, sell, or merge the project before everyone’s paid, the reference price makes sure your supporters get a fair payout.

It’s not about “valuation” in the VC sense – just a clear number everyone agrees on, to protect both sides.

### ✅ Revenue share & payback

You decide:

* What % of project revenue gets shared
* For how long
* If there's a cap on the total return your backers receive (for example: you might share 5% of revenue until they've received 5x what they gave you).

Royalties are based on **gross revenue** – only payment fees, refunds, and taxes are deducted. No murky "expenses" to argue about. Backers can easily verify their share, and builders are motivated to spend wisely since costs don't reduce what's owed.

### ✅ Built-in exit protection

Backers are protected if you sell, merge, or shut down the project:

* They receive a fair payout based on their share of the reference price.
* No waiting for a "maybe someday" exit – they're covered either way.

This keeps things honest for both sides: builders can exit when it makes sense, and backers know they won't be left empty-handed.

## ✅ Why builders love it

* **Easy:** plug-and-play agreements, simple terms.
* **Fair:** clear revenue sharing – not equity or control.
* **Flexible:** fund just what you need, when you need it.
* **Honest:** backers get paid when you get paid.

## 💡 Why early-stage backers should love it

Backers aren’t stuck waiting years for a big exit – they get returns from day one of real sales.

* **Early upside:** the minute revenue comes in, they share in the success.
* **Aligned goals:** the more the project earns, the better for everyone.
* **Exit-protected:** if the project sells, you get your fair share – no hoping for a payout that may never come.
